HOPEFULLY THIS MAY HELP A POOR STUDENT ONE DAY

This stuff will lead to a trained model of YOLO on the ADE20k dataset

##code to train model (run in this directory)

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")

results = model.train(data="ADE20k.yaml", epochs=WhateverYouWantHere)

If you dont want to use the massive amount of labels in ADE20k, and would prefer a subset (whatever it may be),
you will very very sadly have to write a script to parse through the JSONs of ADE20k in order to only extract objects from images with the
correct classes. After that, just place the new list of classes (in python list format, ie [data1,data2,...]) and replace 1599 with the new length of the class list.

HAVE FUN
